SMB Enumeration

3 Ports open

smb on 139 and 445

ssh on 22

found share called 'profiles' using enum4linux (python variant)
smb share 'profiles' allows anonymous access

logging in with anonymous works and we have a file saying that ssh is enabled for our profile

is .ssh we also have a pub and private key

reading the pub file we see the user name and therefore able to login in to 'cactus' using the private key and get the flag
