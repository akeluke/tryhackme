Linux priviledge escalation techniques:

Kernel Exploits
Sudo 
SUID
Capabilities
Cron Jobs
PATH
NFS

Enumeration:
------------------------

# 'hostname' -- gets the hostname of the target, not very valuable but can show machines
role in a wider network
# 'uname -a' -- gets linux version
# 'cat /proc/version' -- view linux version and gcc version (if installed)
# 'cat /etc/issue' -- distro version

# 'ps' -- view running processes on the system
	# 'ps -A' shows all running processes
	# 'ps axjf' shows the process tree
	# 'ps aux' shows processes for all users, the user that launched the process and a	  also processes not attached to a terminal

# 'env' -- shows the enviroment variables 
# 'sudo -l' -- shows commands that can be executed as root
# 'cat /etc/passwd' -- shows all users on the machine

# 'netstat' -- can be used to show communications being made by the machine
	# 'netstat -a' shows all listening ports and established connections
	# 'netstat -at' or 'netstat -au' can be used to list tcp and udp protocols
	# 'netstat -l' shows ports in listening mode
	(parent processes may not be shown as the command sometimes requires root)
	# 'netstat -tp' shows current connections and it's parent process
	# 'netstat -ltp' shows listening ports and its parent process
	# 'netstat -i' lists active interfaces

	# 'netstat -ano' this is an overall good one, it lists all sockets, doesnt resolve 	  hostnames and displays timers

# ALL LINUX COMMANDS CAN HAVE ERRORS REDIRECTED USING '-type f 2>/dev/null"

# 'find' -- this command can be used to find files and executables with the SUID permission bit
	
	# 'find . -name FILE_NAME' can be used to find files
	# 'find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null' finds files with SUID bit

Kernel Exploits
---------------------

IF the target system is running an outdated version of the linux kernel, then there may
be the chance that a kernal exploit is possible.

To do this just check online for any known exploits with the linux kernel version (uname -a), as OBVIOUSLY we are not going to finding and writing 0days for a tryhackme ctf...

you can transfer the exploit over python's simplehttp and wget on the victim machine.
we used CVE-2015-1328 for this task.
