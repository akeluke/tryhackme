CAPA or Common Analysis Platform for Artifacts is a tool desgined to identify the capabilities present in executable files (PE, ELF, .NET Modules, Shellcode and even sandbox reports). 

It does this by analysing and applying a set of rules that describe common behaviours allowing it to determine what the program is capable of doing such as network communication, file manipulation, process injection and many more.

Capa is run in the windows command line using 'capa.exe EXECUTABLE'

it will analyse the file and generate a report..

the report can be analysed in a .txt file, however if you were to run

'capa -j -vv EXECUTABLE > NAME.json'

we could load the json file into an online tool called CAPA Web Explorer
which provides a pretty interface for exploring the executable in detail.
