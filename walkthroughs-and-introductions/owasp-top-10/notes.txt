OWASP Top 10.

OWASP or Open Worldwide Application Security Project is a foundation to improve the security of software.

Number 1 - Broken Access Control
------------------------------------
Broken access control is where an attacker is able to bypass authorisation and them to do things they shouldn't be able to.

For example, editing a 'id=1' param on a website to see other things you shouldnt be allowed

Number 2 - Cryptographic failuers
------------------------------------
This referes to the misuse or lack of use of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensetive information

such as a database file being available, or a weak password.

Number 3 - Injection
------------------------------------
Injection attacks can happen when an application interperets user controlled input as commands or parameters.

Common Examples:

SQL Injection: Occurs when user input is passed as SQL Queries.
Command Injection: Occurs when user input is executed as system commands

Number 4 - Insecure Design
------------------------------------
Insecure design refers to vulnerabilities which are inherent to the application's architecture

Number 5 - Security Misconfiguration
------------------------------------

Security misconfigurations include:

    Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets.
    Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.
    Default accounts with unchanged passwords.
    Error messages that are overly detailed and allow attackers to find out more about the system.
    Not using HTTP security headers.


Number 6 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
------------------------------------
Can be used to exploit

Number 7 - Identification and Authentication Failures
------------------------------------
Preventing hackers from breaking authentication methods such as preventing bruteforcing / password guessing on weak passwords, weak session cookies etc.

Number 8 - Software and Data Integrity Failures
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data should checked to make sure it wasnt modified during transit.
It can lead to vulneralbilitys such as malicious code being injected into the source of an external package or cookies being modified.

Number 9 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Failure to capture or read logs.

Number 10 - SSRF Server Side Request Forgery
------------------------------------------------------------------------
