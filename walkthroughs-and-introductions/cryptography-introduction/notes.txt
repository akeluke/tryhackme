RSA is based on the difficult problem of factoring (finding the two numbers multiplied together) a large number.

It’s simple to multiply two prime numbers together even on paper, say 113 × 127 = 14351. Even for larger prime numbers, it would still be a feasible job, even by hand. Consider the following numeric example:

    Prime number 1: 982451653031
    Prime number 2: 169743212279
    Their product: 982451653031 × 169743212279 = 166764499494295486767649

Finding the factor of 166764499494295486767649 is quite difficult and it gets harder the larger the number

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is an asymmetric way of two parties exchanging keys to then continue communicating using symmetric encrypytion
