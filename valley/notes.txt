ssh/22
http/80
ftp/37370

after a ton of gobustering
we found /static/00
which has this:

dev notes from valleyDev:
-add wedding photo examples
-redo the editing on #4
-remove /dev1243224123123
-check for SIEM alerts

view page source and then viewing dev.js we have a terrible login system which reveals:


    if (username === "siemDev" && password === "california") {
        window.location.href = "/dev1243224123123/devNotes37370.txt";

and we get this:

dev notes for ftp server:
-stop reusing credentials
-check for any vulnerabilies
-stay up to date on patching
-change ftp port to normal port

then logging into to FTP with: siemDev:california works

analysing the files with wireshark, we search for x-www-form-urlencoded (login details etc)
we found one: valleyDev:ph0t0s1234

lets try ssh with that ... and were in

suspicious thing in /etc/crontab (python script)

in /home we have an executable file name valley authenticator 
running strings on that is a string along the lines of 'passwd'
above is hash and crackstation sees it as an md5 hash with the password: liberty123

which gives us user 'valley'

we can edit the base64 import file previous found to be used in the root crontab python script and get a root shell
and get the root flagz
