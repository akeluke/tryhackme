A couple of interesting ports after an nmap -sC -sV port scan

port 80 (http), 
445,139,135,3389,8080

host seems to be a windows server machine version 2008 R2

http server on port 80 seems empty

http server on port 8080 seems interesting, after doing some guided research
the software running (hfs or http file server 2.3) is vulnerable to a couple exploits


exploiting the software in metasploit gets a shell..
