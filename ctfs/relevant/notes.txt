SMB enumeration on the server provided us with some share called 'nt4wrksv'

the smb share contains one file called 'passwords.txt'

after investigation, this seems like some sort of honeypot and infact , on a very high port '49663' is a seperate webserver

which has the directory /nt4wrksv

fuzzing this didnt find anything, but looking for the file found on the smb share, we can read it
this therefore tells us that the SMB share is also this webservers folder...

if we can upload files to the smb server we may be able to upload a reverse shell and run it through the web server


we are able to upload a aspx shell over smb
then using msfconsole, msfvenom we can get a meterpreter shell..
and the user flag

The windows machine is vulnerable to an exploit called 'PrintSpoofer', it uses a vulnerability in the windows impersonsation perms and allows a user to escalate to system / admin level priveleges.
