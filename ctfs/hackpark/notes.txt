Another room similar to a walkthrough, giving hints along the way.


This room will cover brute-forcing an accounts credentials, handling public exploits, using the Metasploit framework and privilege escalation on Windows.


There is a webpage, and the room suggests using hydra to bruteforce the login page.

I will use the username admin. and the wordlist rockyou.txt

We SHOULD ALWAYS OPEN BURP AND COPY THE REQUEST AS IS!!
No matter the form or coookie, JUST COPY THE REQUEST!


this gave us
admin:1qaz2wsx

This version of the blog website is vulnerable to CVE-2019-6714 

Following the exploit gets a reverse shell on the machine.

Lets get a proper shell on the machine with msfvenom

We can run piece of powershell code to download winpeas, run it and find out some exploits on the machine.

after running winpeas we see an usual shell with read/write perms for everyone

'WindowsScheduler'

    WindowsScheduler(Splinterware Software Solutions - System Scheduler Service)[C:\PROGRA~2\SYSTEM~1\WService.exe] - Auto - Running
    File Permissions: Everyone [WriteData/CreateFiles]
    Possible DLL Hijacking in binary folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler (Everyone [WriteData/CreateFiles])
    System Scheduler Service Wrapper


Looking at the logs, we see that the binary 'Message.exe' is being executed, we can replace this with our own shell

waiting a couple of seconds gets an admin shell!
