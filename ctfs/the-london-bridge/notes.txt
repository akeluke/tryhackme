The London Bridge CTF

10.10.132.138

Website running on 8080
using gunicorn

'Gallery' page where users can upload pictures of london

contact page than when used takes to another page displaying your name saying thank you

<script>alert("xss completed!");</script>

xss test on contact form failed

'.php' file upload failed on gallery

tried using jhead to hide php code in the image file however the code does not execute

after a little help, i used a different wordlist with gobuster and found
'/dejaview'
where images can be uploaded through a link

after attemping some SSRF methods i knew, it was still no use.
after looking at a writeup it is requied to use the tool 'ffuf' to fuzz for hidden parameters


COMPLETE LATER,, TOO DIFICULT
