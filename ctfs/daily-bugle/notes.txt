Daily Bugle THM room.

Given a couple hints:
Joomla CMS 
Exploit using SQLi
Practice cracking hashes
Escalate priveledges taking advantage of YUM

10.10.10.3

Joomla Version can be viewed in file :
http://****/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml

this version is 3.7.0

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42033

it seems to vulnerable to sql, using this url:

/index.php?option=com_fields&view=fields&layout=modal&list[fullordering]=updatexml%27

using the python script found here: we can dump the databases

https://github.com/stefanlucas/Exploit-Joomla/blob/master/joomblah.py

running this script gets us a password hash:

Found user ['811', 'Super User', 'jonah', 'jonah@tryhackme.com', '$2y$10$0veO/JSFh4389Lluc4Xya.dfy2MF.bZhz0jVMw.V.d3p12kBtZutm', '', '']


$2y$10$0veO/JSFh4389Lluc4Xya.dfy2MF.bZhz0jVMw.V.d3p12kBtZutm

running on default john password list gets us:

spiderman123

lets try and ssh using: 

jonah:spiderman123

doesnt seem to work, lets try and login to the site using these details

this works.

after running linpeas we see a plaintext password:

nv5uz9r3ZEDzVjNu

this could be the possible password for the user 'jjameson' 
which it is and we can ssh into this user with this password

after running sudo -l we can see we can execute yum as sudo, which on gtfobins gets us root access
