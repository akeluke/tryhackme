https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1938

the server does have the AJP port open 8009/ajp13

lets try this in metasploit

running it shows us some user info:

skyfuck:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks

lets SSH this... and it works

we have 2 files in /home/skyfuck
and user.txt in /home/merlin

a credential.pgp and tryhackme.asc

running john on tryhackme.asc with rockyou.txt

gave us the key for credential.pgp

and decrypting that gave us:

merlin:asuyusdoiuqoilkda312j31k2j123j1g23g12k3g12kj3gk12jg3k12j3kj123j

logging into merlin and running sudo -l allows for ZIP to be run as root
which is GTFO bin priv esc and therefore gives us root
/root/root.txt
