port 80: HTTP site (fuel cms 1.4)

robots.txt -> points to /fuel/

seems to be a login page

trying: admin:admin

successful! leave this for later..

after a super simple search we see that this page is open to an exploit, with the code on exploitdb. It seems to be a command injection exploit and the python script runs the commands.

after attempting many things, i thought about using 'wget' to download a php shell as the web app uses php, then using the php shell we are able to escalate from a simple command injection to real shell.

download linpeas from our machine and run it..
