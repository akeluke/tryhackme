FTP server allows anon login - seems empty

web server on 1337
empty index

fuzzing directories finds a couple :

admin
javascript
phpmyadmin
server-status
admin_101

/admin 
is a login page and displays
displays 'Is this the right admin portal?'

/admin_101
is the same login page but has an email already in login field
hacker@root.thm

attempting to login shows something weird in the browser console, it shows a sql command with the email inputted


messages: Array [ "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = 'test'" ]

possibly try and break out of this?

using SQLMap we are able to preform a MYSQL injection on the target.

a bit of help using this guide: 

https://medium.com/@christophelimpalair/bypass-admin-login-with-sql-injections-sqlmap-bb60d447a1e2

the back-end DBMS is MySQL

we can then dump the data using sqlmap and get the password to 

hacker@root.thm : VeryDifficultPassword!!#@#@!#!@#1231

which gets us to a weird page on chat.php


looking at other things dumped by sqlmap we also see:

/file1010111/index.php? | 69c66901194a6486176e81f5945b8929

and 

/upload-cv00101011/index.php | // ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH USERNAME STARTING WITH Z
